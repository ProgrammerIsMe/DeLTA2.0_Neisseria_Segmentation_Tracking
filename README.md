# Neisseria_Segmentation_Tracking

## Background
Our research aims to segment and track Neisseria that are growing in two dimensions

Using our own training dataset, we train the segmentation model and test the performance

## Steps
1. Preparation for starting: show gpu and memory information
2. Pip install necessary packages: install all the necessary packages
3. Load functions for image display: functions to show image frames
4. Generate weight map: use delta.data.seg_weights_2D()
5. Rename the images: load the images in each folder and rename it as s1_1
6. Combine all the images together: combine all the images into img, seg and wei
7. Pre-processing: image normalization and invert to generate the images for network input
8. Train own model: 
- split 10% dataset for validation
- train model and save it as unet_pads_seg.hdf5
- calculate the accuracy on test dataset using tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()
9. Display the output images: show the images in sequence movies
10. Test the model performace: test segmentation network and tracking network together
